## requirments

1. npm i --save-dev nodemon prettier : 

then we have to make a file name ".prettierrc" - this make the code pretty 
after that we can also make .prettierignore file -- .prettierignore is a file where you tell Prettier to skip certain files or folders when formatting your project.

### to use dotenv we have to do some steps:

     install : npm i dotenv
     then we import dotenv in index.js to use it

### cores:
     install : npm i cors

     CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

     It's a security feature implemented by browsers to control which origins (domains) can access your backend APIs.

# Notes to connect mongodb:

first we have to make a constants file and export a const name DB_NAME with string name of the database
then add a index.js file in db folder and make a async await 


ðŸ”§ Why use async/await with mongoose.connect()?
mongoose.connect(...) is asynchronous

    It takes time to connect to MongoDB (especially over a network).
    It returns a Promise.
    So we must wait for it to finish before doing anything else.
