/*
Why only message in super()?

Because super() can only accept what the parent class constructor is built to handle.

The native Error class is only built to accept one argument: message.

Other values like statusCode, errors, success â€” those are custom properties you define after calling super():
*/

/*
if (stack) { this.stack = stack }

    This checks if a stack value was passed into the constructor (manually).

    If so, it uses that value.

ðŸ§  Why?
Sometimes developers manually set a custom stack for special error handling (e.g., when rethrowing or wrapping an error).

Error.captureStackTrace() is a built-in V8 (Node.js) method that:

    Captures the current call stack (i.e., where the error was thrown),

    Assigns it to this.stack,

    Excludes the constructor function (this.constructor) from the trace, so it's cleaner.
