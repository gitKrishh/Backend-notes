Excellent follow-up!

When we say **‚Äútemporary‚Äù**, we mean that the file is stored **only on the server** ‚Äî and usually only for **a short period** or for **further processing**.

Let me explain clearly:

### üß® Why Multer File Storage Is "Temporary"

1. **Server restarts wipe files**
   Platforms like **Render**, **Heroku**, or even many personal setups use **ephemeral file systems**, meaning:

   * Files stored using Multer will be deleted if:

     * The server restarts
     * The deployment updates
     * There's a crash

2. **Not meant for long-term storage**
   Storing files on your server‚Äôs local disk:

   * Is not scalable (limited space)
   * Is not distributed (only available on *that* server)
   * Has no backup or CDN

3. **Better solutions exist for file storage**
   After temporarily accepting the file:

   * You typically upload it to **Cloudinary**, **Amazon S3**, or **Firebase Storage**.
   * These platforms provide:

     * URLs for file access
     * Backups
     * CDNs for fast delivery

### üì¶ Real-world flow:

| Step | What Happens                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | User uploads a file via frontend form                        |
| 2    | **Multer** stores it in `uploads/` folder on server          |
| 3    | Your backend **uploads** that file to **Cloudinary/S3**      |
| 4    | You store the cloud file's **URL** in your DB                |
| 5    | Optionally delete the file from local server (to free space) |

---

### üßπ Optional Cleanup

After uploading to Cloudinary, you might delete the file locally like this:

```js
import fs from "fs";

fs.unlinkSync(localFilePath); // deletes file from local disk
```

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Local Multer Storage | Cloudinary / S3      |
| -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Temporary            | Permanent            |
| On your server only  | Globally available   |
| No backup/CDN        | Has backup + CDN     |
| Risky for production | Ideal for production |
