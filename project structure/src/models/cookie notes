That’s a **very thoughtful** and important question—and it shows you’re starting to understand **how authentication works under the hood**.

Let’s clarify your question first:

> **“If the server *already knows* the JWT it sent, why should it need the browser to send the cookie back?”**

---

## 🔑 Answer:

### ❗The server **does not store** the JWT after sending it. That’s the whole point of using JWTs.

> ✅ **JWTs are stateless.**
> Once the server creates and sends a JWT, **it forgets about it**. It doesn’t store it in memory or in a database.

---

## 🔁 So what happens?

### 1. **Server creates a JWT when the user logs in:**

```js
const token = jwt.sign({ id: user._id, role: user.role }, secretKey, { expiresIn: "15m" });
```

### 2. **Server sends the token to the client (in a cookie):**

```js
res.cookie("accessToken", token, options).json({ ... });
```

✅ Now the **browser stores it** in cookies.

---

### 3. **Later, the client makes another request:**

The browser sends:

```http
GET /api/v1/user/profile
Cookie: accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

### 4. **Server receives the JWT back and verifies it:**

```js
const decoded = jwt.verify(req.cookies.accessToken, secretKey);
```

➡️ Only *then* can the server identify who the user is.
Because the server **never stored the JWT**, it relies on the client to send it back.

---

## 💡 Why don’t we store it on the server?

Because:

* 🔹 JWTs are designed to be **stateless** (scalable & fast).
* 🔹 No server-side memory/database lookup is needed.
* 🔹 Works well with **microservices** or **load balancers** (no sticky sessions).
* 🔹 Efficient for **mobile + frontend apps** that handle their own session logic.

---

## 🔒 But what about security?

* We **sign the token** so no one can tamper with it.
* We **set it as a cookie (HttpOnly + Secure)** so JS can’t read it (protects from XSS).
* We set **expiration times** so it doesn’t stay valid forever.

---

## ✅ Summary:

> The **server doesn’t remember or store the JWT**.
> That’s why the **browser (client)** must send it back (via cookies or headers)
> so the server can verify and authenticate the user on **every** request.

Would you like to compare this with **sessions**, where the server *does* remember things?
